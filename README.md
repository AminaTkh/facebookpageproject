# facebook page project
WarwickLove is an online community for Warwick Students. With more than 7,000 likes and followers, it is the place where people express their idea and confession anonymously. In this project, we try to discover what the community of students from the University of Warwick is most interested in, excited, and worried about by analysing the posts from the Facebook page.
